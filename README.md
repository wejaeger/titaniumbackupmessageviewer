This is a GUI application to view conversation files created from the following Applications:

- Titanium Backup
- SMS Backup and Restore
- Skype



It displays both sides of a conversation (SMS/MMS/Skype) on the right screen side in chronological order. Each item is displayed like a conversation bubble in a cartoon.

On the left side a list box of threads is displayed. In this way it groups conversations from the same person and phone number together.
