      <title>Titanium Backup Message Viewer</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      This document is the API specification for the Titanium Backup Message
      Viewer application.
      <p>
         This is a Swing GUI application to view the XML files created from the
         Android App <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup">Titanium Backup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Those message XML files are located under the folder <b>TitaniumBackup</b>
         on the mobile phone and have following name pattern:
         <code>com.keramidas.virtual.XML_MESSAGES-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.xml.gz</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         Unfortunately, the XML file does not contain the contact's name.
         Therefore you can optionally choose a contacts database to look up
         contact's name from phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
         Contacts database is stored as {@code contacts2.db} in a archive file
         with name pattern
         {@code com.android.providers.contacts-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz} in the
         {@code TitaniumBackup} folder on the mobile phone.
      </p>
      <p>
         MMS Message currently only support message parts with following
         content type:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>text/plain</li>
         <li>text/x-vCard</li>
         <li>image/jpeg</li>
         <li>application/smil</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <code>SMIL</code> implementation is rudimentary because it does
         not honor layout description, it only cares for correct order of
         message parts.
      </p>
      <p>
         The GUI displays both sides of a messaging (SMS/MMS) conversation on
         the right screen side in chronological order. Each message is
         displayed like a conversation bubble in a cartoon.
      </p>
      <p>
         On the left side a list box of message threads is displayed.
         In this way it groups messages from the same person and phone number
         together.
