      <title>Titanium Backup Message Viewer</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      This document is the API specification for the Titanium Backup Message
      Viewer application.
      <p>
         This is a GUI application to view the XML files created from the
         Android App <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup">Titanium Backup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Those message XML files are located under the folder <b>TitaniumBackup</b>
         on the mobile phone and have following name pattern:
         <code>com.keramidas.virtual.XML_MESSAGES-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.xml.gz</code>
      </p>
      <p>
         It displays both sides of a messaging (SMS/MMS) conversation on the
         right screen side in chronological order. Each message is displayed
         like a conversation bubble in a cartoon.
      </p>
      <p>
         On the left side a list box of message threads is displayed.
         In this way it groups messages from the same person and phone number
         together.
